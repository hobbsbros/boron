# The Boron Standard Library

Provides the Boron compiler with a list of simple functions.

A subset of these functions (those contained in the Boron prelude `std::prelude`) are imported automatically at compile time.

The remainder of these functions can be imported manually by the user.

# WIP Disclaimer

This is still a work-in-progress.  Software is continuously forthcoming.
